# stash
This stash is for development of several studies and practise.

Make some differences.

May 19
Make this stash a draft for hungry-snake project.
First, build a framework for this game.

May 21
Framework functional. But the "node" abstract is done badly. Maybe using
some derived class later.

May 24
Add a compatitive mode in the game. Two snakes simultanious run for one apple.
